                        <h3>PhD position in computational astrochemistry </h3>

                        <p> 
                            We invite applications for a PhD position in computational astrochemistry at the School of Physics at University College Dublin, Ireland. You will work with Dr Marie Van de Sande on the ERC Starting Grant ASHES on dust formation in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most stars will go through an AGB phase near the end of their lives, losing their outer layers by means of a stellar outflow and enriching the interstellar medium (ISM) with the building blocks for the next generation of stars and planets. This outflow is driven by dust formation. Despite the importance of dust, we still do not know exactly how it is formed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will extend a large chemical reaction network to include dust nucleation, using the results of quantum chemical calculations, and calculate the first 1D bottom-up dust growth models. As a next step, you will create 3D chemical models by post-processing hydrodynamical models, helping to close the gap between theory and observations. As part of the ERC Starting Grant ASHES, there are ample opportunities for attending conferences, workshops, and research stays. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project would be suitable for a student with a degree in chemistry, physics or astronomy who wants to build on their skills in coding (python and Fortran), data analysis and visualisation, and would like to work in chemical kinetics modelling. 
                        </p>
