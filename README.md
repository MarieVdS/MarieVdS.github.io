I am an astrochemist with a particular interest in molecules and dust around evolved stars.
My research is focussed on developing chemical models for AGB outflows, in an attempt to help explain the rich complexity of observations.

## Current position
Postdoctoral Fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) at the Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven, Belgium

## Outreach
I enjoy talking about my research, and astronomy and astrochemistry in general, to a variety of audiences. 
This includes talks at secondary schools and public observatories, as well as organised events such as Pint of Science.
